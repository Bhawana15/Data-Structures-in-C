/* C++ PROGRAM TO COUNT MINIMUM DELETE OPERATIONS REQUIRED TO MAKE ALL ELEMENTS OF ARRAY SAME 
 * Given an array of n elements such that elements may repeat.
 * We can delete any number of elements from array.
 * The task is to find minimum number of elements to be deleted from array to make it equal.
 * In this problem we need to minimize the delete operations.
 * The approach is simple, we count frequency of each element in array, then find the frequency of most frequent element in count array.
 * Let this frequence be max_freq.
 * To get the minimum number of elements to be deleted from array calculate n â€“ max_freq where n is number of elements in given array. */
